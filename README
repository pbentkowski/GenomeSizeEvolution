Welcome to Genome Size Evolution project!
----------------------------------------
For writing this project I have used:
  - NetBeans for coding, https://netbeans.org/index.htm
  - Doxygen and Doxywizard for generating documentation, http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/
IN 00_CurrentCode one can find nbproject directory. If you running NetBeans as well, you can load a NetBeans project from there.
