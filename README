Welcome to Genome Size Evolution project!
----------------------------------------
For writing this project I have used:
  - NetBeans for coding, https://netbeans.org/index.htm
  - Doxygen and Doxywizard for generating documentation:
    http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/

In direcotry 00_CurrentCode one can find nbproject directory. If you running 
NetBeans as well, you can load a NetBeans project from there.

Direcotry Doc containes documentation in HTML format. Find file 'index.htm' and
run it in a browser to view the docs. Do not alter files in Doc manually, as they 
are generated automatically by Doxygen. File 'Doxyfile' contains the setup for 
Doxygen (you mignt need to tweek some dir paths at your local workstation).

Directory 01_PyScrips contains Python scripts used for plotting and analysys
of the output files. They are rather poorly documented - sorry :-(
SigleRuns - scripts for processing single simulation.
MultiRuns - scripts for processing and comparing a larger number of simulations, 
often varying in parameter setup between each other.
GenotypeAnalysys - scrips for counting mutations and evolution raleted stuff.
