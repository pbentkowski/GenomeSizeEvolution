Welcome to Genome Size Evolution project!
----------------------------------------
For writing this project I have used:
  - NetBeans for coding, https://netbeans.org/index.htm
  - Doxygen and Doxywizard for generating documentation:
    http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/

To compile one needs GNU Scientific Library, http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/ ,
installed. It's in any GNU/Linux repos.

In the directory 00_CurrentCode one can find nbproject directory. If you running 
NetBeans as well, you can load a NetBeans project from there.

Directory Doc contains documentation in HTML format. Find file 'index.htm' and
run it in a browser to view the docs. Do not alter files in Doc manually, as they 
are generated automatically by Doxygen. File 'Doxyfile' contains the set-up for 
Doxygen (you mignt need to tweek some dir paths at your local workstation -
Doxywizard is a GUI front-end to Doxygen one might find useful).

Directory 01_PyScrips contains Python scripts used for plotting and analysis
of the output files. They are rather poorly documented - sorry :-(
SigleRuns - scripts for processing single simulation.
MultiRuns - scripts for processing and comparing a larger number of simulations, 
often varying in parameter set-up between each other.
GenotypeAnalysys - scripts for counting mutations and evolution related stuff.
