Welcome to Genome Size Evolution project!
-----------------------------------------

This is an implementation of a model presented in the paper:

Bentkowski P, Oosterhout CV, Mock T (2015) A model of genome size 
evolution for prokaryotes in stable and fluctuating environments. 
Genome Biol Evol evv148. doi: 10.1093/gbe/evv148

You can get it from here (it's Open Access):
http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/08/03/gbe.evv148

The "Master" branch includes the newest stable development. For the 
ORIGINAL code from the publication check this branch:

For writing this project I have used:
  - NetBeans for coding, https://netbeans.org/
  - Doxygen and Doxywizard for generating documentation:
    http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/

To compile one needs GNU Scientific Library, http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/ ,
installed. It's in any GNU/Linux repos. To read the documentation you need to
download the thing first.

In the directory '00_CurrentCode' one can find nbproject directory. If you running 
NetBeans as well, you can load a NetBeans project from there.

Directory 'Doc' contains documentation in HTML format. Find file 'index.htm' and
run it in a browser to view the docs. Do not alter files in Doc manually, as they 
are generated automatically by Doxygen. File 'Doxyfile' contains the set-up for 
Doxygen (you mignt need to tweek some dir paths at your local workstation -
Doxywizard is a GUI front-end to Doxygen one might find useful).

Directory '01_PyScrips' contains Python scripts used for plotting and analysis
of the output files. They are rather poorly documented - sorry :-(
SigleRuns - scripts for processing single simulation.
MultiRuns - scripts for processing and comparing a larger number of simulations, 
often varying in parameter set-up between each other.
GenotypeAnalysys - scripts for counting mutations and evolution related stuff.

All simulations were carried out on the High Performance Computing Cluster supported
by the Research and Specialist Computing Support service at the University of East Anglia.
